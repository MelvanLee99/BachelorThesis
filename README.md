# Exploration of Optimal Geometric Median Point Search Method Using Weiszfeld Algorithm
An undergraduate thesis project for Bachelor of Science, this project focuses how to utilize the clustering point by using Weiszfeld algorithm as an alternative clustering methods rather than using scikit-learn package within single amount and multiple amount of clustering point. On multiple clustering points, I use the hard clustering and probabilistic assigments methods using the algorithm given to interpret the weighted data and order q. This model also intepret with using Xie-Beni Index to show which model is the best for probabilistic assignments methods.
